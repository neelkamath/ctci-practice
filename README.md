# Cracking the Coding Interview Practice

My attempts at learning algorithms and data structures by attempting to solve the problems given in the book _Cracking
the Coding Interview: 189 Programming Questions and Solutions_.

## Installation

- Clone the repo using one of the following steps:
    - `git clone git@github.com:neelkamath/ctci-practice.git`
    - `git clone https://github.com/neelkamath/ctci-practice.git`
- Install [OpenJDK 16 (HotSpot)](https://adoptopenjdk.net/?variant=openjdk16&jvmVariant=hotspot).

## Usage

1. Go to the program's directory (e.g., `cd src/chapter-1-arrays-and-strings/1.1/App.class`).
2. Compile and run the program (e.g., `javac App.java && java App`).

## Contributing

Each solution is stored in a path that follows the convention `src/<CHAPTER>/<QUESTION>/App.java`. For example, the path
for the solution to question 1.1 in the chapter "Array and Strings" is `src/chapter-1-arrays-and-strings/1.1/App.java`.
